******************

Rerio
"""""

Rerio is comprised of "research release" basecalling models and configuration files.
All models are compatible with Guppy (see `Nanopore Community page <https://community.nanoporetech.com/downloads>`_ for download/install instructions).
Since research models often utilise new features, the latest version of Guppy may be required.

The research models provide cutting-edge functions, speeds and accuracies that have not been productionised or validated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies in the Guppy executable basecaller. Nevertheless, models and config files can be run with the basecalling infrastructure in Guppy executable by using the instructions available in this repository.

Models are provided for DNA and RNA, various pore types and to basecall different modified bases in a variety of contexts.

Features
--------

- New and advanced research models that are at the forefront of nanopore sequencing analyses (e.g. highest accuracies, quickest speeds, more modified basecalls in more contexts)
- Functions with `Megalodon <https://github.com/nanoporetech/megalodon>`_ (2.0 and above) to call modified DNA bases

**Note:** The results generated by research basecalling models have not been scrutinized nor validated and Oxford Nanopore cannot support each use case (see Research Release disclaimer)

*********************

Getting started
"""""""""""""""

Follow the instructions below to use research models with Guppy executable.

Dependencies
------------

You will require:

- Python-compatible environment (e.g. Terminal)
- The most recent Guppy version, available on the Nanopore Community `Software downloads page <https://community.nanoporetech.com/downloads>`_.

**Note:** Rerio is versioned by the minimum version of Guppy required to run _all_ models in the repository. 
A new release of Rerio will be tagged when a model is added that requires a more recent version of Guppy.


Installation
------------

Rerio can be downloaded by cloning from GitHub ``git clone https://github.com/nanoporetech/rerio``.
Once Rerio has been downloaded, models can be downloaded via the ``download_model.py`` script.

::

   # Download all models
   rerio/download_model.py
   # Download specific model(s)
   rerio/download_model.py rerio/basecall_models/res_dna_r941_min_modbases-all-context_v001

Once desired models have been downloaded, they can be run by specifying the Guppy data path option (``-d`` or ``--data_path``) and selecting the desired config file (``-c`` or ``--config``).

::

   ./ont-guppy/bin/guppy_basecaller -i fast5s/ -s basecalled_fast5s \
       -d ./rerio/basecall_models/ \
       -c res_dna_r941_min_modbases-all-context_v001.cfg

Megalodon Support
-----------------

Rerio research models can be run within megalodon by specifying the data directory in the ``--guppy-params`` argument.

::

   megalodon fast5s/ --guppy-params "-d ./rerio/basecall_models/" \
       --guppy-config res_dna_r941_min_modbases-all-context_v001.cfg

Barcoding Support
-----------------

The Rerio GitHub code repository includes a minimal barcoding stub to allow Guppy to run successfully.
In order to enable full Guppy barcoding capabilities, all barcoding files must be transferred from the guppy data directory to the rerio data directory.

::

   cp ont-guppy/data/barcoding/* rerio/basecall_models/barcoding/

Research Release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Research releases are provided as technology demonstrators to provide early access to features or stimulate Community development of tools. Support for this software will be minimal and is only provided directly by the developers. Feature requests, improvements, and discussions are welcome and can be implemented by forking and pull requests. However much as we would like to rectify every issue and piece of feedback users may have, the developers may have limited resource for support of this software. Research releases may be unstable and subject to rapid iteration by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.
